  <summary><h3>1. What are Jetpack Compose compiler metrics?<h3/></summary>

The [`Compose`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) `Compiler plugin` can generate `reports/metrics` around certain Compose-specific concepts that can be useful in understanding what is happening with some of the `Compose` code at a fine-grained level.
    
It can output various performance-related `metrics` at build time, allowing us to peek behind the curtains and see where any potential `performance issues` are.

## 2. Why Mendable?

Altho, the `metrics` generated by the `Compose Compiler` are in pseudo-Kotlin style function signatures, which are reasonably readable. But, over time these files get big and unwieldy to work with, and checking each-and-every `composable` in those `txt files` becomes cumbersome and clumsy. Also, these reports are spread across different `files` for different `modules`.

That is where `Mendable` comes in and takes care of generating `HTML reports` for `Compose` `compiler metrics`, which are much easier to work with. And `Mendable` only presents `composable` methods which require your attention, and highlights the issue-causing part with appropriate colors. It filters out the rest of the `composables` which are non-problematic.

`Mendable` also takes reports of `multiple modules` and merges them into different `sections` of a single beautiful `HTML page` to reduce going back and forth while working.

> **Note** : `Mendable` only generates `HTML report` for the `composables` `metrics`. In other words, it only targets the `<module>-composables.txt` `files`.
