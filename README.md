  <h1>A <code>CLI</code> tool to convert <code>multi-module</code> <code>Jetpack Compose</code> compiler <code>metrics</code> into beautiful <code>HTML</code> reports</h1>

</div>

<details>
  <summary><h2>1. What are Jetpack Compose compiler metrics?<h2/></summary>

The [`Compose`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) `Compiler plugin` can generate `reports/metrics` around certain Compose-specific concepts that can be useful in understanding what is happening with some of the `Compose` code at a fine-grained level.
    
It can output various performance-related `metrics` at build time, allowing us to peek behind the curtains and see where any potential `performance issues` are.

## 2. Why Mendable?

Altho, the `metrics` generated by the `Compose Compiler` are in pseudo-Kotlin style function signatures, which are reasonably readable. But, over time these files get big and unwieldy to work with, and checking each-and-every `composable` in those `txt files` becomes cumbersome and clumsy. Also, these reports are spread across different `files` for different `modules`.

**That is where Mendable comes in and takes care of generating `HTML reports` for `Compose` `compiler metrics`, which are much easier to work with. And Mendable only presents `composable` methods which need your attention, and highlights the issue-causing part with appropriate colors. It filters out the rest of the `composables` which are non-problematic.**

Mendable also takes reports of `multiple modules` and merges them into different sections of a single beautiful `HTML page` to reduce going back and forth while working.

> **Note** : Mendable only generates HTML report for the composables metrics. In other words, it only targets the '<module>-composables.txt` files.

<details>
  <summary><h2>3. Gradle setup - for generating Compose compiler metrics</h2></summary>
  
Add the following lines to your **root project's** `build.gradle` file. This will direct the Compose compiler to generate metrics and save all of them into the **root project's** `build folder` (for all of the `modules`).

<details open>
  <summary><code>Groovy</code></summary>
  
``` groovy
subprojects {
    tasks.withType(org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile).configureEach {
        kotlinOptions {
            // Trigger this with:
            // ./gradlew assembleRelease -PenableMultiModuleComposeReports=true --rerun-tasks
            if (project.findProperty("enableMultiModuleComposeReports") == "true") {
                freeCompilerArgs += ["-P", "plugin:androidx.compose.compiler.plugins.kotlin:reportsDestination=" + rootProject.buildDir.absolutePath + "/compose_metrics/"]
                freeCompilerArgs += ["-P", "plugin:androidx.compose.compiler.plugins.kotlin:metricsDestination=" + rootProject.buildDir.absolutePath + "/compose_metrics/"]
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><code>Kotlin scipt</code></summary>
  
```kotlin
allprojects {
    tasks.withType(org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.KotlinCompile::class.java).configureEach {
        kotlinOptions {
            // Trigger this with:
            // ./gradlew assembleRelease -PenableMultiModuleComposeReports=true --rerun-tasks
            if (project.findProperty("enableMultiModuleComposeReports") == "true") {
                freeCompilerArgs += listOf("-P", "plugin:androidx.compose.compiler.plugins.kotlin:reportsDestination=" + rootProject.buildDir.absolutePath + "/compose_metrics/")
                freeCompilerArgs += listOf("-P", "plugin:androidx.compose.compiler.plugins.kotlin:metricsDestination=" + rootProject.buildDir.absolutePath + "/compose_metrics/")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

With the above setup, you can generate Compose compiler metrics by executing the following `command` in the `terminal` window.

```
./gradlew assembleRelease -PenableMultiModuleComposeReports=true --rerun-tasks
```
</details>

## 4. How do I use Mendable?

> **Note** : The following steps assume that you have a similar `gradle` setup as to the one described in [step 3](https://github.com/jayasuryat/mendable#3-gradle-setup---for-generating-compose-compiler-metrics).

It is very straightforward. Download and execute the `jar` file while **pointing it to the appropriate directory** which contains all of the Compose compiler-generated metrics files.

Mendable will take care of the rest. It will figure out metrics files of individual `modules`, `parse` them, `compute` and `generate` a beautiful `HTML report` for you. 

### 4.1 ✨ Generate HTML report with a single command ✨
Download and place the `jar` file in the same folder which contains all of the generated Compose compiler metrics (should be YourProject/build/compose_metrics). And then execute the `jar` file with the following `command`.
```
java -jar mendable.jar
```
After executing this `command` there should be `index.html` file generated in the same folder, which will contain the combined metrics of all the modules.

<details>
    <summary><h3>4.2 Generate HTML report by specifying paths manually</h3></summary>
    
While the above method is the easiest, and should work fine for most of the use cases, Mendable also supports reading and writing files to custom locations. The following are the supported options via `CLI arguments`.
```
java -jar mendable.jar
    --composablesReportsPath, -i  [Default value : <Current working dir>] -> Path to the directory containing all of the composables.txt files
    --htmlOutputPath, -o          [Default value : <Current working dir>] -> HTML output directory
    --outputName, -oName          [Default value : "index"]               -> Name of the output HTML file
    --help, -h                                                            -> Usage info
```
For example : 
```
java -jar mendable.jar
    -i /Users/username/Desktop/Your-project/build/compose_metrics \
    -o /Users/username/Desktop/Reports \
    -oName Your-project-metrics \
```
For the above command, files will be `read` from '/Users/username/Desktop/Your-project/build/compose_metrics' and the `output` file will be `saved` at '/Users/username/Desktop/Reports' and that file will be `named` 'Your-project-metrics.html'.
