Although, the `metrics` generated by the `Compose Compiler` are in pseudo-Kotlin style function signatures, which are
reasonably readable. But, over time these files get big and unwieldy to work with, and checking
each-and-every `composable` in those `txt files` becomes cumbersome and clumsy. Also, these reports are spread across
different `files` for different `modules`.

**That is where Mendable comes in and takes care of generating `HTML or  JSON reports` for `Compose` `compiler metrics`,
which
are much easier to work with. And Mendable only presents `composable` methods which need your attention, and highlights
the issue-causing part with appropriate colors. It filters out the rest of the `composables` which are
non-problematic.**

Mendable also takes reports of `multiple modules` and merges them into a single beautiful `HTML page` or a cohesive
`JSON report` to reduce going back and forth while working.

    `HTML` reports provide a `glanceable` & `actionable` view over which `composables` are **`unstable`**, suitable for
    identifying and fixing performance related issues.

    `JSON` reports are more suitable for having an overview of how many composables are present and what percentage of
    them are stable. `Json` format is more suitable for enabling checks in `CI pipelines`. And furthermore, these
    `.json` outputs could be committed to the `VCS` to track stability characteristics changes over time.
